# CDPR

The main tasks of:
-Creating the backend API wit Spring Boot
-Visitors browsing and searching games
-Admins adding, updating or deleting games
Are done. However there are no tests.

The website consists of 4 pages: Home, Game, Admin and Search.

Home page: has the game catalogue, visitors can click on games and go to their respective Game page with information.
Admin: Admins can add games or edit the database from this page.
Search: Visitors can search for games by the title.

The overall design is a mix of CD Projekt Red and GOG websites. It's very basic.

Problems:
There are no tests.
There are no logins.
There is no cart/purchase system.
Needs better responsiveness.
The code and folders are messy at parts.
Instead of editing bootstrap themes I override given classes so there isn't a general theme file. This is the biggest issue.

Overall the project is pretty simple and the problems can be fixed with some extra time.
